This is an emotion tracker application, created to record and store your daily emotions.

We are building an application that will track your daily emotion and record notes.
Our app helps users to be able to record emotions without the pressure to write an entire diary entry.
The end user will be anyone, and will let the user over time using the app, be able to track his emotions throughout time.

This project contains image files in assets/appimages. There are five main files:
- Emotion.dart
This class creates an Emotion Object
- EmotionBox.dart
This class creates the box that will be displayed as a recorded emotion.
- EmotionListModel.dart
This class sorts out which emotion the user selected to store and display later
- main.dart
This is the main class to run for the application.
- SQLiteDbProvider.dart
This class handles what happens when the user decided to record their daily emotion.
